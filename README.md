This Video was made by HyIsNoob, but as it has nearly the same stuff as this mod, I just used his!

**This is a fork of the [Orbital Railgun](https://modrinth.com/mod/orbital-railgun) mod by [Mishkis](https://modrinth.com/user/Mishkis) that adds sounds and other useful features!**

**Photosensitivity Warning**: This mod uses a lot of shader effects, fast-moving lights, and chromatic abjuration. Viewer discretion is advised.

An unoffical forge version can be found [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/orbital-railgun-reforged).

## Description

If you've ever wanted to destroy large swathes of land in an instant while having no regard for the local fauna and wildlife present, then our new invention of the Orbital Railgun may interest you. By harnessing the power of a star, you are able to communicate directly to our rapid-response railgun satellite, allowing for quick and easy access to absolute destruction. Simply aim your Orbital Railgun and fire, and within half a minute you will have caused an ecological disaster, but at least the area is clear now!

*Note: it **WILL** destroy bedrock.*

## Usage

![Crafting Recipe](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/591ad1cff565f3726f685eacf8416eda0a18ff3a.png)

Once you've crafted the Orbital Railgun, hold `right click` to aim and then `left click` to fire.

## Configuration

Access the config screen through Mod Menu (if installed) to customize:
- Volume Settings: Adjust the volume for each sound (scope, shoot, equip) from 0.0 to 1.0
- Enable/Disable Sounds: Toggle individual sound effects on or off

Configuration is stored in `config/orbital-railgun-sounds.json5` in your Minecraft directory.

## Installation

1. Place the JAR in your `mods` folder alongside Orbital Railgun and Fabric API.
2. This is a client-side addon; you can join servers as long as your client has the original mod installed.
